<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>My name is Austin Le, and I am an upcoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (EECS).</p>

<p>I enjoy learning, teaching, creating new things, and playing video games. On campus, I am an active officer of <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Eta Kappa Nu</a>, the EECS Honor Society, an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="http://cs61a.org">CS 61A</a>, and one of two head facilitators/instructors of the <a href="http://www.decal.org/courses/lol">League of Legends DeCal</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I&rsquo;ve recently gotten into developing my personal website and side projects, having been inspired by my work and co-workers this summer. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented strategy and gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but currently mostly play <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/">Guild Wars 2</a>. I have a soft spot for the MMORPG genre.</p>

<p>In Summer 2014, I interned at Google&rsquo;s Feedback team in Mountain View, and in Summer 2015, I returned to intern at Google&rsquo;s App Engine Admin API (part of Google Cloud Platform) team in Seattle.</p>
