<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>My name is Austin Le, and I am an upcoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (EECS).</p>

<p>I enjoy learning, teaching, creating new things, and playing video games. On campus, I am an active officer of <a href="www.hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu">Eta Kappa Nu</a>, the EECS Honor Society, an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="www.cs61a.org">CS 61A</a>, and one of two head facilitators/instructors of the <a href="www.decal.org/courses/lol">League of Legends DeCal</a>.</p>

<p>In my free time, I&rsquo;ve recently gotten into developing my personal side projects (see below) and web development. I am also very passionate about video games from a very young age and greatly enjoy their depth of strategy, immersive worlds, and challenging experiences. Currently, I play <a href="www.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a> and <a href="www.guildwars2.com">Guild Wars 2</a>.</p>

<p>In Summer 2014, I interned at Google&rsquo;s Feedback team in Mountain View, and in Summer 2015, I returned to intern at Google&rsquo;s App Engine Admin API (part of Google Cloud Platform) team in Seattle.</p>
