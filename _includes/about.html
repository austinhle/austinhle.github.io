<h3 style="font-weight: 500">A little about me</h3>
<div style="font-size: 175%">
  <p class="about">My name is Austin Le, and I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS).</p>

  <p class="about">I love learning, teaching, experimenting with technology, contemplating our complicated world, and playing video games.</p>

  <p class="about">On campus, I am the corresponding secretary of <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Eta Kappa Nu, Mu chapter</a> (the EECS Honor Society), an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="http://cs61b.ug" target="_blank" class="link">CS 61B (Data Structures)</a>, a facilitator & instructor of the <a href="http://www.decal.org/courses/lol" target="_blank" class="link">Analytical Thinking in League of Legends DeCal</a>, and an amateur dancer in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AFXdance/" target="_blank" class="link">AFX Dance</a>.</p>

  <p class="about">In an academic setting, I enjoy studying both the theoretical and practical sides of computer science. However, my main interests lie in the applications of computer graphics, human-computer interaction, machine learning, and artificial intelligence that help create interesting and powerful technology that augments everyday life for people. Particular applications I am fascinated by are virtual reality, augmented reality, context-aware computing, smart devices, and the Internet of Things. I'm an avid follower of the growth of virtual reality and hope to become more and more involved in its development as I continue to pursue my professional and academic careers.</p>

  <p class="about">Outside of school, I've recently gotten into developing my personal website and side projects, having been inspired by my work and co-workers this summer. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented, strategic gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but currently mostly play <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a> and <a href="http://www.bladeandsoul.com/en/" target="_blank" class="link">Blade and Soul</a>. I have a particularly weak spot for the MMORPG and RPG genres.</p>

  <p class="about">In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Mountain View office on the Feedback team, and in Summer 2015, I returned to work at Google's Seattle office on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/" target="_blank" class="link">App Engine Admin API</a> team (part of Google Cloud Platform). Next summer, I will be a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Riot Games</a> in Los Angeles, working within their Service Availability Initiative.</p>
