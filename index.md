# Austin Le - Student, teacher, software engineer, gamer.

## Biography
My name is Austin Le, and I am an upcoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS).

I enjoy learning, teaching, creating new things, and playing video games. On campus, I am an active officer of [Eta Kappa Nu](www.hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu), the EECS Honor Society, an undergraduate student instructor for [CS 61A](www.cs61a.org), and one of two head facilitators/instructors of the [League of Legends DeCal](www.decal.org/courses/lol).

In my free time, I've recently gotten into developing my personal side projects (see below) and web development. I am also very passionate about video games from a very young age and greatly enjoy their depth of strategy, immersive worlds, and challenging experiences. Currently, I play [League of Legends](www.leagueoflegends.com) and [Guild Wars 2](www.guildwars2.com).

In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Feedback team in Mountain View, and in Summer 2015, I returned to intern at Google's App Engine Admin API (part of Google Cloud Platform) team in Seattle.
