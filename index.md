<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>My name is Austin Le, and I am an upcoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS).</p>

<p>I enjoy learning, teaching, creating new things, and playing video games. On campus, I am an active officer of <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Eta Kappa Nu</a>, the EECS Honor Society, an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="http://cs61a.org" target="_blank" class="link">CS 61A</a>, and one of two head facilitators/instructors of the <a href="http://www.decal.org/courses/lol" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends DeCal</a>.</p>

<p>In an academic setting, I enjoy studying both the theoretical and practical sides of computer science. However, my main interests lie in the applications of computer science, creating interesting and useful tools for everyday users. I recently completed a course on Operating Systems and Systems Programming and did an internship in the area of distributed systems (Google Cloud Platform), which I've found to be a very interesting and practical use of computer science. On the more theoretical end, I am fascinated by the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have enabled awesome technology like the new Google Photos and Google Translate apps. I've also recently completed courses on AI and ML and hope to take further classes in this field in the next few semesters.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I've recently gotten into developing my personal website and side projects, having been inspired by my work and co-workers this summer. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented strategy and gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but currently mostly play <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/" target="_blank" class="link">Guild Wars 2</a>. I have a soft spot for the MMORPG genre.</p>

<p>In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Mountain View office on the Feedback team, and in Summer 2015, I returned to work at Google's Seattle office on the App Engine Admin API team (part of Google Cloud Platform).</p>
