## Biography
My name is Austin Le, and I am an upcoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS).

I enjoy learning, teaching, creating new things, and playing video games. On campus, I am an active officer of [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/), the EECS Honor Society, an undergraduate student instructor for [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org), and one of two head facilitators/instructors of the [League of Legends DeCal](http://www.decal.org/courses/lol).

In the academic setting, I enjoy studying both the theoretical and practical sides of computer science. However, my main interests lie in the applications of computer science, creating interesting and useful tools for everyday users. I recently completed a course on Operating Systems and Systems Programming and did an internship in the area of distributed systems (cloud), which I find to be a very interesting and practical application of computer science. On the more theoretical end, I am fascinated by the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have enabled new, awesome technology like the updated Google Photos and Google Translate applications.

Outside of school, I've recently gotten into developing my personal website and side projects, having been inspired by my work and co-workers this summer. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented strategy and gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but currently mostly play [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) and [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/). I have a soft spot for the MMORPG genre.

In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Feedback team in Mountain View, and in Summer 2015, I returned to intern at Google's App Engine Admin API (part of Google Cloud Platform) team in Seattle.
