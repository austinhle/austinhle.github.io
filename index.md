## Biography
My name is Austin Le, and I am an upcoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS).

I enjoy learning, teaching, creating new things, and playing video games. On campus, I am an active officer of [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/), the EECS Honor Society, an undergraduate student instructor for [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org), and one of two head facilitators/instructors of the [League of Legends DeCal](http://www.decal.org/courses/lol).

Outside of school, I've recently gotten into developing my personal website and side projects, having been inspired by my work and co-workers this summer. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented strategy and gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but currently mostly play [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) and [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/). I have a soft spot for the MMORPG genre.

In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Feedback team in Mountain View, and in Summer 2015, I returned to intern at Google's App Engine Admin API (part of Google Cloud Platform) team in Seattle.
