        <p class="about">My name is Austin Le, and I am a 1st year graduate student at Princeton University pursuing a Master's Degree in Science and Engineering (M.S.E.) in <a href="http://cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Science</a>. My research interests are in computer graphics and vision, and especially in their applications in virtual/augmented reality, immersive computing, and interactive visual experiences. For more details on my past experience and background, check out my CV/Resume in the top-right corner!</p>

        <p class="about">Outside of my academic work, I am a midcore PC gamer and try to make time for it in my weekly schedule. I play a large variety of games, but my favorite genres are MMORPGs and MOBAs. Currently, I've been spending my free game time in the virtual worlds of <a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a>, and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale" target="_blank" class="link">Fortnite</a>. Besides gaming, I also like to spend my downtime reading, watching anime, and attempting to get myself into shape at the gym.</p>
