        <p class="about">My name is Austin Le, and I am a 1st year graduate student at Princeton University pursuing a Master's Degree in Science and Engineering (M.S.E.) in <a href="http://cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Science</a>. My research interests are in computer graphics and vision, and especially in their applications in virtual reality, immersive computing, and interactive visual experiences.</p>

        <p class="about">Outside of my academic work, I am a midcore PC gamer and make time for it in my schedule every week. I play a large variety of games, but my favorite categories are MMORPGs and MOBAs. Currently, I mainly play <a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Final Fantasy XIV</a> as well as a bit of <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a>. Besides gaming, I spend my free time reading, watching anime, and working out at the gym.</p>
