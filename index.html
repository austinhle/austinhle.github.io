      <div style="font-size: 175%">
        <p class="about">I am a 2nd-year graduate student at Princeton University pursuing my M.S.E. degree in <a href="http://cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Science</a>. I'm fascinated by interactive real-time computer graphics, computer vision, and image processing, and especially in their applications in new and immersive technology such as virtual/augmented reality, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As I approach the end of my Masters degree, I aspire to play a role in pushing the boundaries of these fields to improve day-to-day life and create exciting new immersive experiences.</p>
          
        <p class="about">I love learning as much as I do teaching, especially in Computer Science. In Fall 2018, I am helping teach COS 217 (Programming Systems), which will be my 7th semester serving as a teaching assistant across both my undergraduate and graduate studies.</p>

        <p class="about">In my free time, I am a midcore gamer and try to make time for it in my weekly schedule. Most recently, I have been exploring the beautiful world of <a href="https://www.destinythegame.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Destiny 2</a> and taking on its more difficult team-based end-game challenges. Besides gaming, I spend my downtime reading, watching anime, learning Japanese, and trying to get into better physical shape. When I can find a large enough contiguous chunk of time and the funds, I love to travel!</p>
        
        <p class="about">I intend to graduate with my Masters degree in June 2019, so I am currently looking for full-time opportunities to apply my experience and enthusiasm towards meaningful and exciting challenges in computer vision and graphics, all the while learning as much as I can from my work and my colleagues.</p>
