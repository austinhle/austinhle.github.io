      <div style="font-size: 175%">
        <p class="about">My name is Austin Le, and I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.S. in <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS)</a>. As a student in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/honors.html" target="_blank" class="link">EECS Honors Degree program</a>, I am also pursuing an additional breadth within Cognitive Science and Psychology.</p>

        <p class="about">I love learning, teaching, experimenting with technology, contemplating the complicated real and virtual worlds, and immersing myself in video games.</p>

        <p class="about">On campus, I am currently involved in multiple student groups and activities, which include:</p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Department Relations Officer of <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Eta Kappa Nu, Mu chapter</a> (the EECS Honor Society)</li>
          <li>Undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://bid.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Berkeley Institute of Design</a> working with graduate student <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~andrewhead/" target="_blank" class="link">Andrew Head</a> under <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/" target="_blank" class="link">Professor Bjorn Hartmann</a></li>
          <li>A research member in the <a href="http://www.isaacs.io" target="_blank" class="link">ISAACS (Immersive Semi-Autonomous Aerial Command System)</a> team as part of the <a href="http://vr.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Virtual Reality at Berkeley club</a> working in conjunction with the <a href="https://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Berkeley Robotics and Intelligent Machines Lab</a></li>
          <li>An undergraduate student instructor (UGSI) for <a href="http://cs61b.ug" target="_blank" class="link">CS 61B (Data Structures)</a>. My teaching ratings are publicly available on <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/8416" target="_blank" class="link">HKN's website</a>. I'm also a recipient of the <a href="http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/" target="_blank" class="link">Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award</a>.</li>
          <li>An amateur dancer in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AFXdance/" target="_blank" class="link">AFX Dance</a> (shoutout to the AFX JK Crew team!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="about">In an academic setting, I enjoy studying both the theoretical and practical sides of computer science. However, my main interests lie in the applications of computer graphics, image processing, human-computer interaction, machine learning, and computer vision that help create interesting and powerful technology that augments everyday life for people. Particular applications I am fascinated by are virtual reality, augmented reality, context-aware computing, smart devices, and the Internet of Things. I'm a virtual and augmented reality enthusiast and hope to become more and more involved in its development as I continue to pursue my professional career. With my breadth in Cognitive Science and Psychology, I hope to apply concepts in human perception and cognition to research and development being done in virtual and augmented reality.</p>

        <p class="about">Outside of school, I am working on improving my web development skills in order to slowly improve the presentation and quality of my website. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented, strategic gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but currently mostly play <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a> and <a href="http://www.bladeandsoul.com/en/" target="_blank" class="link">Blade and Soul</a>. I have a particularly weak spot for the MMORPG and RPG genres. I am super excited for the public release and consumption of virtual headsets Oculus Rift and HTC Vive and to get the chance to play and experiment with them in my free time.</p>

        <p class="about">In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Mountain View office on the Feedback team, and in Summer 2015, I returned to work at Google's Seattle office on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/" target="_blank" class="link">App Engine Admin API</a> team (part of Google Cloud Platform). Next summer, I will be a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Riot Games</a> in Los Angeles, working within their Service Availability Initiative.</p>
