      <div style="font-size: 175%">
        <p class="about">My name is Austin Le, and I am a 4th year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.S. in <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS)</a>. As a student in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/honors.html" target="_blank" class="link">EECS Honors Degree program</a>, I am also pursuing an additional breadth within Cognitive Science and Psychology.</p>

        <p class="about">I love learning, teaching, experimenting with technology, contemplating the real and virtual worlds, and immersing myself in video games.</p>

        <p class="about">On campus, I am currently the President of <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Eta Kappa Nu, Mu chapter</a> (the EECS Honor Society), serving as an Undergraduate Student Instructor for CS 184, Computer Graphics and Imaging, and working as an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://graphics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Visual Computing Lab</a> working with graduate student <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bmild/" target="_blank" class="link">Ben Mildenhall</a> under <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/yirenng.html" target="_blank" class="link">Professor Ren Ng</a>.</p>

        <p class="about">In an academic setting, I enjoy studying both the theoretical and practical sides of computer science. However, my main interests lie in the applications of computer graphics, image processing, computational imaging, and human-computer interaction that create interesting and powerful technology that augments everyday life for people. Particular applications I am fascinated by are virtual reality, augmented reality, and real-time rendering. I'm a virtual and augmented reality enthusiast and hope to become more and more involved in its development as I continue to pursue my professional career. With my breadth in Cognitive Science and Psychology, I hope to apply concepts in human perception and cognition to research and development being done in these areas.</p>

        <p class="about">Outside of school, I am working on improving my web development skills in order to slowly improve the presentation and quality of my websites and project reports. I am also very passionate about online multiplayer video games and greatly enjoy what they have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented, strategic gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but some notable favorites of mine over the years have been <a href="http://www.runescape.com", target="_blank", class="link">RuneScape</a>, <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a>, and both the original Guild Wars 1 and its sequel <a href="http://www.guildwars2.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Guild Wars 2</a>.

        <p class="about">In Summer 2014, I interned at Google's Mountain View office on the Feedback team, and in Summer 2015, I returned to work at Google's Seattle office on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/" target="_blank" class="link">App Engine Admin API</a> team (part of Google Cloud Platform). In Summer 2016, I was a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Riot Games</a> in Los Angeles, working within their Service Availability Initiative, on the rCluster team, which develops and builds back-end infrastructure and systems that help run League of Legends at a global scale.</p>
