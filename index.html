      <div style="font-size: 175%">
        <p class="about">I am a 2nd-year graduate student at Princeton University pursuing my M.Eng. degree in <a href="http://cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Science</a>. I'm fascinated by interactive real-time computer graphics, computer vision, and image processing, and especially in their applications in new and immersive technology such as virtual/augmented reality, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As I approach the end of my Masters degree, I aspire to play a role in pushing the boundaries of these fields to improve day-to-day life and create exciting new immersive experiences.</p>
          
        <p class="about">I love learning as much as I do teaching, especially in Computer Science. In Spring 2019, I am helping teach COS 426 (Computer Graphics), which will be my 8th (and final) semester serving as a teaching assistant across both my undergraduate and graduate studies.</p>

        <p class="about">In my free time, I am a midcore PC gamer and try to make time for it in my weekly schedule. Currently, you can find me on an epic journey on Old School RuneScape, and tentatively hyped for the release of Anthem. In general, I love online multiplayer games! Besides gaming, I spend my downtime reading, watching anime, learning Japanese, and trying to get into better physical shape. When I can find a large enough contiguous chunk of time and the funds, I also love to travel!</p>
        
        <p class="about">After graduating in June 2019, I will be joining Adobe to work on the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank" class="link">Adobe XD</a> team to continue delivering amazing and immersive UX design experiences at uncompromising levels of performance in prototyping and rendering.</p>
