      <div style="font-size: 175%">
        <p class="about">I am a graduate student at Princeton University pursuing my Master's Degree in Science and Engineering (M.S.E.) in <a href="http://cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Science</a>. My research interests are in computer graphics and vision, and especially in their applications in virtual/augmented reality, immersive computing, and interactive visual experiences. I previously received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2017.</p>
        
        <p class="about">I love learning as much as I do teaching, especially in Computer Science. In Spring 2018, I am helping teach COS 217 (Programming Systems), which will be my 6th semester serving as a teaching assistant in my entire career.</p>

        <p class="about">In my free time, I am a midcore gamer and try to make time for it in my weekly schedule. I am constantly exploring various virtual online worlds, but you can usually find me climbing the ladder on my one of my core games, <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a>. Besides gaming, I spend my downtime reading, watching anime, learning Japanese, and trying to get into better physical shape.</p>
