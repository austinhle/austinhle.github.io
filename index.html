      <div style="font-size: 175%">
        <p class="about">My name is Austin Le, and I am a 4th year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a B.S. in <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS)</a>. As a student in the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/honors.html" target="_blank" class="link">EECS Honors Degree program</a>, I am also pursuing an additional breadth within Cognitive Science and Psychology.</p>

        <p class="about">I love learning, teaching, experimenting with technology, contemplating the real and virtual worlds, and immersing myself in video games.</p>

        <p class="about">On campus, I am currently the President of <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Eta Kappa Nu, Mu chapter</a> (the EECS Honor Society), an Undergraduate Student Instructor for CS 184 (Computer Graphics and Imaging), and an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://graphics.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="link">Visual Computing Lab</a> working with graduate student <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bmild/" target="_blank" class="link">Ben Mildenhall</a> under <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/yirenng.html" target="_blank" class="link">Professor Ren Ng</a>.</p>

        <p class="about">My academic and research interests are in computer graphics, computer vision, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and augmented reality. With my breadth in Cognitive Science and Psychology, I hope to apply concepts in human perception and cognition to research and development in these fields and be a part of the next revolution in graphics and VR/AR.</p>

        <p class="about">In my free time, I have been improving my web development skills, reading, and attempting to maintain a regular gym schedule. I am also passionate online gamer and greatly enjoy what modern video games have to offer: immersive worlds, challenging experiences, and team-oriented, strategic gameplay. I play a large variety of games, but some notable favorites of mine over the years have been <a href="http://www.runescape.com", target="_blank", class="link">RuneScape</a>, <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/" target="_blank" class="link">League of Legends</a>, and both the original Guild Wars and its sequel <a href="http://www.guildwars2.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Guild Wars 2</a>.
